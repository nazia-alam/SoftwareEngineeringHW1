## Purpose of Contributing
* Maintain our product quality
* Fix bugs and problems
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible to our product
## Code of Conduct
All contributors should abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read this carefully before contributing.

## Pull Request Submission Guidelines
###  Install Git
First thing first, you should install and configure the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine.

[Set Up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) is a good source for you to set up.

###  Fork Our Repositroy
To contribute code to our product, you must have a Github account so you could push code to your own fork and open Pull Requests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nazia-alam/SoftwareEngineeringHW1)
### Work On Your Own branch
Once done and you have the code locally on the disk, you can get started. We advice to not work directly on the master branch, but to create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. That way you can easily switch between different work, and you can update each one for latest changes on upstream master individually.
### Write Code
For writing the code just follow our [Python style guide](###Python-Styleguide)
